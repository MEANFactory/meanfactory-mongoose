## Related Projects
The following projects have been designed specifically to work with each other:

**[mf-mongoose-audittrail](https://github.com/MEANFactory/mf-mongoose-audittrail)**  
Track who and when documents are created and updated without complex programming.  Compare and contract different versions of each document.

**[mf-mongoose-dto](https://github.com/MEANFactory/mf-mongoose-dto) (this plugin)**  
Convert to/from JSON DTO while applying optional level-based hiding.

**[mf-mongoose-softdelete](https://github.com/MEANFactory/mf-mongoose-softdelete)**

**[mf-mongoose-validation](https://github.com/MEANFactory/mf-mongoose-validation)**  
Provides additional validation for extended data types, field lengths, arrays, and other useful features.

And, for convenience...

**[mf-mongoose-plugins](https://github.com/MEANFactory/mf-mongoose-plugins)**
